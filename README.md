## Requirements

- Cotonti 0.9.15 or greater
- Page module (the one provided in the main Cotonti package)

## Installatione

- Download, unzip and place the `wiki` folder into your Cotonti's plugin directory
- Install the plugin through the administration panel

## Enabling the wiki functionality on page structures

By default, wiki functionality is disabled on all page structures. Once the wiki plugin is installed, you can go into any page structure and enable wiki functionality for that structure alone, or on all structures that are children of that structure.

To do this, go to configuration section of a page structure and you will see wiki configuration options.
